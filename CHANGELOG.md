## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

This release is the fork's coming-out story: `netadvanced/vikunja-mcp` started from
`democratize-technology/vikunja-mcp` at `0.2.2` with a failing test suite and a set of confirmed
API-contract bugs, and became `vikunja-mcp-ng` — a direct-REST, composite-first, Docker-distributed
MCP server with roughly triple the capability surface it started with. See
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the full wave-by-wave account this entry summarizes.

### Added

- Real saved filters, project sharing (link shares plus direct user/team sharing), project
  views/Kanban bucket CRUD, and project duplication (#55, #57, #58, #59).
- Notifications, subscriptions, and reactions tools (#56).
- Task extras: direct `GET /tasks` as the primary listing strategy, position/by-index access, and
  subtask composites (#64, #77).
- Attachments (read-side), API tokens, admin operations, and server info tools (#62, #63).
- A local Docker e2e stack and an MCP-layer end-to-end harness that drives the real stdio server
  via the SDK client and asserts on the wire protocol (#65, #67).
- Opt-in JSON file persistence for `vikunja_templates`, configurable via `templates.persistPath` /
  `VIKUNJA_MCP_TEMPLATES_FILE` (#78).
- Global read-only / write-off-by-default mode, layered on top of per-module config gating (#81).
- MCP tool annotations (`readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint`) so capable hosts can
  auto-approve reads and gate destructive calls (#81).
- Docker distribution: multi-stage `Dockerfile`, compose example, `docs/DOCKER-DESKTOP-MCP.md`.
- `docs/ENDPOINT-PLAYBOOK.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and a scenario-driven README with a
  `docs/samples/` walkthrough page per scenario.

### Changed

- **Renamed the project and package to `vikunja-mcp-ng`** — package name, bin name, MCP server
  identity, and `server.json` all updated (#74).
- All HTTP now goes through a single REST helper (`vikunjaRestRequest`) on TypeScript types
  generated from a vendored OpenAPI spec (`docs/vikunja-openapi.json`), with `opossum`-backed retry
  and named circuit breakers (#49, #52).
- Introduced layered module configuration (defaults → `vikunja-mcp.config.json` → env, env wins)
  with deny-by-default gating for dangerous modules (admin, user deletion, token management), plus
  `*_FILE` env-var variants for Docker Swarm / Kubernetes secrets (#51).
- Added `CompositeOperation`, an opt-in best-effort saga helper with compensations and trace
  reporting for multi-call composite tools (#50).
- Coverage thresholds ratcheted upward four times in step with real, measured coverage growth
  (#48, #60, #66, #82).

### Fixed

- Test suite repaired from 190 failing tests to fully green (#31–#46), then held there through
  every subsequent wave — 130 suites / 2,900 tests / 0 failing as of this release.
- 16 confirmed API-contract bugs, including: team management being entirely non-functional (5
  bugs), project *move* silently wiping unrelated fields, share creation sending field names the
  API ignored, reminder removal that could never succeed, relation counts always reading zero, and
  user settings read from the wrong response nesting level (#31–#41).
- Two security-validation regressions caught in the same audit sweep (#31–#41).

### Removed

- **`node-vikunja` dependency removed entirely.** The client library this project originally
  depended on was frozen upstream (last release May 2025) with confirmed drift from the live API.
  Migrated per-domain across Wave D (tasks core, task sub-resources, projects/labels/teams/users,
  composites) and dropped from `package.json` in the final removal PR (#73). Verified zero-hit via
  `grep -rn node-vikunja src/ package.json package-lock.json`.

## [0.2.2] - fork point

Fork point from [`democratize-technology/vikunja-mcp`](https://github.com/democratize-technology/vikunja-mcp)
at `0.2.2`. Everything above `[0.3.0]` in this file describes work done on the fork
(`netadvanced/vikunja-mcp`, now `vikunja-mcp-ng`); history prior to the fork point lives in the
upstream project.

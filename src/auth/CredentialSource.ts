/**
 * Credential source: identity -> Vikunja credential.
 *
 * Spec: docs/OIDC-RESOURCE-SERVER.md §3(c)/§3(d). A Keycloak/OIDC access
 * token authenticates a *person*, it is not itself a Vikunja credential —
 * the server needs a lookup from the validated identity to a Vikunja `tk_`
 * token. §3(c) specifies that lookup as an encrypted-JSON-file vault, but
 * that is explicitly H2 scope (wave plan, H2-1/H2-3). H1's job is only to
 * shape the seam so H2 plugs in without touching a single call site:
 *
 *  - `VikunjaCredentialSource` — the interface every call site programs
 *    against. `getCredential` returns `null` (never throws) when an
 *    identity has no linked credential; callers turn that into the
 *    structured `AUTH_REQUIRED` "provision" error (`createOidcAuthRequiredError`
 *    below), never a 500, and never anything that reveals whether some
 *    *other* identity is provisioned.
 *  - `StdioCredentialSource` — today's behaviour: one static credential
 *    (from env/config, `src/index.ts`'s existing bootstrap), identity-
 *    independent, because `stdio` mode is single-tenant. This is not a
 *    stub — it's the permanent stdio-mode implementation.
 *  - `OidcStubCredentialSource` — the H1 stand-in for the real vault.
 *    Always returns `null`, so every `oidc-http` caller gets the
 *    provisioning prompt until H2 lands `src/storage/vaultFileStore.ts` and
 *    a vault-backed implementation of this same interface (H2-3). Retained
 *    (not deleted) after H2 lands — still used by tests that want a
 *    deterministic "nobody is ever provisioned" source without touching a
 *    real vault file.
 *  - `VaultCredentialSource` — H2's real implementation, a thin adapter over
 *    `VaultFileStore` (`src/storage/vaultFileStore.ts`). Replaces
 *    `OidcStubCredentialSource` in the production `oidc-http` wiring
 *    (`src/transport/oidcHttpAuth.ts`'s `setupOidcHttpAuth`).

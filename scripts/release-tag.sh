#
# release-tag.sh — tag the current commit as the version in package.json.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-tag.sh
#
# Run this on `main` (stable channel) or `dev` (beta channel), right after a `release: vX.Y.Z`
# PR (from scripts/release-prepare.sh) has merged there. It does NOT bump anything — it only
# tags. See docs/RELEASING.md for the full flow. The npm/GHCR channel (`latest` vs. `beta`) is
# derived from the TAG's version string by the publish workflow, not the branch — but this
# script still refuses a stable version tagged from `dev` or a prerelease tagged from `main`,
# since either would mean a channel published from the wrong line's history.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Verifies we're on `main` or `dev`, the tree is clean, local matches origin, and the
#      version is the kind that branch is allowed to ship (stable on main, prerelease on dev).
#   2. Reads the version out of package.json and verifies no `vX.Y.Z` tag exists yet.
#   3. Extracts the matching CHANGELOG.md section as the tag message.
#   4. Creates an ANNOTATED tag `vX.Y.Z` on HEAD and pushes it.

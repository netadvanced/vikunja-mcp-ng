# Releasing

This is the ruleset for cutting a release of `vikunja-mcp-ng`. It assumes you're comfortable
with git but haven't necessarily tagged or published an npm package before — every step is
spelled out.

Companion reading: [docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for where the project stands, and
[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for what's already shipped.

## The short version

Releases are **deliberate, batch-time acts**, not something that happens automatically on every
merged PR. Someone decides "it's time to cut a release," picks patch or minor, and runs three
scripts. Version numbers change in exactly one kind of PR: a release PR. Nowhere else.

```
decide scope  →  release:prepare  →  review PR  →  merge  →  release:tag  →  release:publish
```

## 1. SemVer policy (pre-1.0)

This project is pre-1.0 (`0.x.y`), so we don't get to lean on strict SemVer's "breaking changes
require a major bump" — major stays at `0` until we declare the project stable (see §4). Instead
we use the common pre-1.0 convention:

| Bump | When | Example from this project |
|---|---|---|
| **patch** (`0.3.0` → `0.3.1`) | Bug fixes, doc corrections, dependency bumps, internal refactors — nothing a caller has to change for | `0.3.0 → 0.3.1`: response-formatting fixes (no tool signatures changed, output shape corrected) |
| **minor** (`0.3.x` → `0.4.0`) | New capability *or* a breaking change to tool inputs/outputs/config. Pre-1.0, minor absorbs both — there's no separate "major" lane to reach for | `0.3.x → 0.4.0`: next capability batch (new subcommands, new tools, or a config-shape change that requires updating `vikunja-mcp.config.json`) |
| **major** (`0.x.y` → `1.0.0`) | Reserved for the deliberate declaration that the project is stable. Not a size threshold — a status change | `1.0.0`: declared-stable criteria — see §4 |

Rule of thumb: **if existing users have to change anything to keep working (config keys, tool
argument shapes, removed subcommands, Node version floor), it's at least a minor bump, even
pre-1.0.** If they don't have to change anything, it's a patch.

When a batch of changes mixes both, the release takes the higher bump (one breaking-ish change in
a batch of ten bugfixes still makes it a minor).

## 2. Tags explained

A **tag** is a fixed, named pointer to one specific commit — unlike a branch, it doesn't move.
This project uses **annotated tags** (`git tag -a`, not lightweight `git tag`), which store a
message, an author, and a date, and can be verified independently of the commit they point at.

- Tag format: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `v0.3.1`), always on `main`, always on the commit that has that
  version in `package.json`.
- No release branches. `main` is the only place work lands and the only place tags are cut from.
- The tag's annotation message is the changelog section for that version — `git show v0.3.1` shows
  you exactly what shipped, no separate lookup needed.
- Pushing a tag matching `v*` is what (eventually) triggers the release workflow — see §6.

## 3. Release checklist

Run through this top to bottom. Steps 1–3 happen on a branch and go through a normal PR review.
Steps 4–6 happen on `main` after that PR is merged.

### Step 1 — Decide scope

Look at what's merged since the last tag (`git log v<last>..main --oneline`, or just read the
`[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` if it's been kept current). Decide **patch** or **minor**
per the table in §1. This is a judgment call — `release:prepare` doesn't decide it for you.

### Step 2 — Run `release:prepare`

```bash
npm run release:prepare -- patch   # or: npm run release:prepare -- minor
```

This script (`scripts/release-prepare.sh`):

- Refuses to run on a dirty tree or on `main` itself — it creates its own branch
  (`release/vX.Y.Z`) off an up-to-date `main`.
- Runs the full gate suite (lint, typecheck, tests, coverage) *before* touching anything —
  a release never starts from red.
- Bumps `package.json` (and `package-lock.json`) with `npm version <patch|minor> --no-git-tag-version`
  — no tag yet, that's step 5.
- Generates a draft changelog section from conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`,
  `docs:`, …) since the last tag, and inserts it into `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
- Commits everything as `release: vX.Y.Z`.
- Prints the next step: push the branch and open a PR.

### Step 3 — Review and curate the changelog, open the PR

The generated changelog section is a **draft**, grouped mechanically by commit prefix. Read it,
merge duplicate lines, cut noise (`chore: fix typo`), rewrite anything terse into something a user
would understand, and make sure entries are in the right Keep a Changelog category (Added /
Changed / Fixed / Removed / Security). This is the one manual step in the whole pipeline — commit
messages are written for git history, changelog entries are written for readers.

```bash
git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z
gh pr create --repo netadvanced/vikunja-mcp --base main \
  --title "release: vX.Y.Z" --body "See CHANGELOG.md"
```

### Step 4 — Merge the release PR

Ordinary PR review and merge, same gates as any other PR. Nothing special except that this PR is
the *only* kind allowed to touch the version field.

### Step 5 — Run `release:tag` (on `main`, after merge)

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
npm run release:tag
```

This script (`scripts/release-tag.sh`) reads the version out of `package.json`, verifies no tag
`vX.Y.Z` already exists, creates an **annotated** tag on `HEAD` whose message is the matching
`CHANGELOG.md` section, and pushes the tag.

### Step 6 — Run `release:publish` (or let the workflow do it)

Today, run it locally against the tagged commit:

```bash
git checkout vX.Y.Z   # or just stay on main right after tagging
npm run release:publish
```

This script (`scripts/release-publish.sh`) re-runs the full gates, then:

- `npm publish --access public`
- builds and tags the Docker image `ghcr.io/netadvanced/vikunja-mcp-ng:X.Y.Z` and `:latest`
  (push only with `--push`)
- `gh release create vX.Y.Z` using the changelog section as the release notes

Once the owner installs `docs/github-workflow-release.yml.example` as
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (see §6), pushing the tag in step 5 does this automatically and
step 6 becomes a manual fallback rather than the normal path.

## 4. What "1.0.0" means

`1.0.0` is deferred until the project is declared stable — that's an explicit owner decision, not
a metric threshold crossed automatically. At minimum it implies: the tool surface (subcommand
shapes, config schema) is not expected to change without a deprecation window, GitHub Actions CI
is live (currently disabled repo-wide, tracked in `docs/ROADMAP.md` §3b), and the owner says so in
a release PR. Until then, every `0.x` release may contain breaking changes in a minor bump per §1
— that's the pre-1.0 deal.

## 5. Who does what

- **Owner**: decides *when* to release and *what scope* (step 1). Reviews and curates the
  changelog (step 3). Approves and merges the release PR (step 4). Decides when to install the
  GitHub Actions workflow (§6).
- **Agents / anyone with repo access**: can execute the mechanical steps (2, 5, 6) once the owner
  has signed off on scope — these are scripts, not judgment calls. An agent should still surface
  the generated changelog for owner review rather than merging it unseen.

## 6. Automation status

- **Today**: three local scripts (`scripts/release-*.sh`) that a human or agent runs by hand, in
  order. No CI dependency.
- **Available, not installed**: `docs/github-workflow-release.yml.example` — a tag-triggered
  (`on: push: tags: ['v*']`) GitHub Actions workflow that does steps 5–6's publish work
  automatically once a tag is pushed. It is deliberately kept as an example file rather than a
  live workflow — installing it under `.github/workflows/` is the owner's explicit act, done when
  ready (see the header comment in that file for the secrets it needs). Everyday PRs are
  unaffected either way: the workflow only ever triggers on a `v*` tag push, never on branches or
  PRs.

## 7. The one rule that matters most

**`main` is always releasable.** Every PR — release or otherwise — must land with lint, typecheck,
and the full test suite (with coverage gate) green. A release should never require "wait, let me
also fix this failing test first" — if it does, that fix is its own PR that lands *before* the
release PR, not folded into it. And version numbers in `package.json` change in release PRs only —
never as a side effect of a feature or fix PR.
